### Markdown File On How I Resolved The Index.js Pool Instance Error
Below is another copy of the corrected code for the index.js broken code given as a task.
Indicated at the corrected section how and what I corrected to fix the issue.

**Corrected Code**:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const app = express();
const pool = new Pool(
    {
        user: "postgres",
        port: 5432,
        host: "localhost",
        database: "users",
        password: ""
    }
);

app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users');
        res.json(result.rows);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error getting users from database", error);
        res.status(500).json({ status: "failed", error: 'Failed to get users' });
        
    }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));
```
**What I Corrected**:
 **Database Credentials Configuration (Pool)**:

- The original code created a Pool instance without providing the necessary database connection details, such as the username, password, host, port, and database name thus i added the database credentials to the Pool configuration


**Error Handling**:

- I added a try-catch block around the pool.query() call to handle any errors that might occur during the database operation.
- In the catch block, I logged the error to the console and returned a JSON response with a 500 status code, indicating an internal server error, and a custom error message.
